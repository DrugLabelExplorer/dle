 Over 550 patients were treated for longer than one year. In placebo-controlled clinical studies, the discontinuation rate due to adverse events for VIAGRA (2.5%) was not significantly different from placebo (2.3%). 
 The adverse events were generally transient and mild to moderate in nature. In trials of all designs, adverse events reported by patients receiving VIAGRA were generally similar. 
 In fixed-dose studies, the incidence of some adverse events increased with dose. The nature of the adverse events in flexible-dose studies, which more closely reflect the recommended dosage regimen, 
 was similar to that for fixed-dose studies. When VIAGRA was taken as recommended (on an as-needed basis) in flexible-dose, placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following adverse events were reported:

 Abnormal Vision: Mild and transient, predominantly color tinge to vision, but also increased sensitivity to light or blurred vision. In these studies, only one patient discontinued due to abnormal vision.  Other adverse reactions occurred at a rate of greater than 2%, but equally 
 common on placebo: respiratory tract infection, back pain, flu syndrome, and arthralgia. In fixed-dose studies, dyspepsia (17%) and abnormal vision (11%) were more common at 100 mg than at lower doses. At doses above the recommended dose range, adverse events were similar to those detailed above but generally were reported more frequently. The following events occurred in less than 2% of patients in controlled clinical trials; a causal relationship to VIAGRA is uncertain.

#  " INDICATION AND USAGE VIAGRA is indicated for the treatment of erectile dysfunction.",
# """CONTRAINDICATIONS Consistent with its known effects on the nitric oxide/cGMP pathway (see   CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  ), VIAGRA was shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects 
# of nitrates, and its administration to patients who are using organic nitrates, either regularly and/or intermittently, in any form is therefore contraindicated. After
# patients have taken VIAGRA, it is unknown when nitrates, if necessary, can be safely administered. Based on the pharmacokinetic profile of a single 100 mg oral dose 
# given to healthy normal volunteers, the plasma levels of sildenafil at 24 hours post dose are approximately 2 ng/mL (compared to peak plasma levels of approximately 440 ng/mL) 
# (see   CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism  ). In the following patients: age >65, hepatic impairment (e.g., cirrhosis), severe renal impairment 
# (e.g., creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min), and concomitant use of potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (erythromycin), plasma levels of sildenafil at 24 hours 
# post dose have been found to be 3 to 8 times higher than those seen in healthy volunteers. Although plasma levels of sildenafil at 24 hours post dose are much lower than at 
# peak concentration, it is unknown whether nitrates can be safely coadministered at this time point. VIAGRA is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to 
# any component of the tablet.""",
# """
# WARNINGS There is a potential for cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease. 
# Therefore, treatments for erectile dysfunction, including VIAGRA, should not be generally used in men for whom sexual 
# activity is inadvisable because of their underlying cardiovascular status. VIAGRA has systemic vasodilatory properties 
# that resulted in transient decreases in supine blood pressure in healthy volunteers (mean maximum decrease of 8.4/5.5 mmHg), 
# (see   CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacodynamics  ). While this normally would be expected to be of little consequence in most patients,
# prior to prescribing VIAGRA, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying cardiovascular disease 
# could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects, especially in combination with sexual activity. Patients with the following 
# underlying conditions can be particularly sensitive to the actions of vasodilators including VIAGRA – those with left ventricular 
# outflow obstruction (e.g. aortic stenosis, idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) and those with severely impaired autonomic 
# control of blood pressure. There is no controlled clinical data on the safety or efficacy of VIAGRA in the following groups; 
# if prescribed, this should be done with caution. Patients who have suffered a myocardial infarction, stroke, or life-threatening 
# arrhythmia within the last 6 months;  Patients with resting hypotension (BP less than 90/50) or hypertension (BP greater than 170/110); 
# Patients with cardiac failure or coronary artery disease causing unstable angina;  Patients with retinitis pigmentosa (a minority of 
# these patients have genetic disorders of retinal phosphodiesterases).  Prolonged erection greater than 4 hours and priapism (painful 
# erections greater than 6 hours in duration) have been reported infrequently since market approval of VIAGRA. In the event of an 
# erection that persists longer than 4 hours, the patient should seek immediate medical assistance. If priapism is not treated 
# immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency could result. The concomitant administration of the protease 
# inhibitor ritonavir substantially increases serum concentrations of sildenafil ( 11-fold increase in AUC ). If VIAGRA is prescribed 
# to patients taking ritonavir, caution should be used. Data from subjects exposed to high systemic levels of sildenafil are limited. 
# Visual disturbances occurred more commonly at higher levels of sildenafil exposure. Decreased blood pressure, syncope, and prolonged
# erection were reported in some healthy volunteers exposed to high doses of sildenafil (200–800 mg). To decrease the chance of adverse
# events in patients taking ritonavir, a decrease in sildenafil dosage is recommended (see   Drug Interactions, ADVERSE REACTIONS   and   DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  ).
# """,
# """OVERDOSAGE In studies with healthy volunteers of single doses up to 800 mg, adverse events were similar to those seen at lower doses but incidence rates and severities 
# were increased. In cases of overdose, standard supportive measures should be adopted as required. Renal dialysis is not expected to accelerate clearance as sildenafil is
#  highly bound to plasma proteins and it is not eliminated in the urine.""",

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
""",
"""Contraindications 
 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
 
Consistent with its known effects on the nitric oxide/cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) 
pathway (see section 5.1), sildenafil was shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of nitrates, and its 
co-administration with nitric oxide donors (such as amyl nitrite) or nitrates in any form is therefore 
contraindicated. 
 
The co-administration of PDE5 inhibitors, including sildenafil, with guanylate cyclase stimulators, 
such as riociguat, is contraindicated as it may potentially lead to symptomatic hypotension (see section 
4.5). 
 
Agents for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, including sildenafil, should not be used in men for 
whom sexual activity is inadvisable (e.g. patients with severe cardiovascular disorders such as 
unstable angina or severe cardiac failure). 
 
3 
 
VIAGRA is contraindicated in patients who have loss of vision in one eye because of non-arteritic 
anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy (NAION), regardless of whether this episode was in connection or 
not with previous PDE5 inhibitor exposure (see section 4.4). 
 
The safety of sildenafil has not been studied in the following sub-groups of patients and its use is 
therefore contraindicated: severe hepatic impairment, hypotension (blood pressure <90/50 mmHg), 
recent history of stroke or myocardial infarction and known hereditary degenerative retinal disorders 
such as retinitis pigmentosa (a minority of these patients have genetic disorders of retinal 
phosphodiesterases). """,
"""4.9  Overdose 
 In single dose volunteer studies of doses up to 800 mg, adverse reactions were similar to those seen at 
lower doses, but the incidence rates and severities were increased. Doses of 200 mg did not result in 
increased efficacy but the incidence of adverse reactions (headache, flushing, dizziness, dyspepsia, 
nasal congestion, altered vision) was increased. 
 
In cases of overdose, standard supportive measures should be adopted as required. Renal dialysis is 
not expected to accelerate clearance as sildenafil is highly bound to plasma proteins and not eliminated 
in the urine. """,
"""
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
 
A medical history and physical examination should be undertaken to diagnose erectile dysfunction and 
determine potential underlying causes, before pharmacological treatment is considered. 
Cardiovascular risk factors 
Prior to initiating any treatment for erectile dysfunction, physicians should consider the cardiovascular 
status of their patients, since there is a degree of cardiac risk associated with sexual activity. Sildenafil 
has vasodilator properties, resulting in mild and transient decreases in blood pressure (see section 5.1). 
Prior to prescribing sildenafil, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with certain 
underlying conditions could be adversely affected by such vasodilatory effects, especially in 
combination with sexual activity. Patients with increased susceptibility to vasodilators include those 
with left ventricular outflow obstruction (e.g., aortic stenosis, hypertrophic obstructive 
cardiomyopathy), or those with the rare syndrome of multiple system atrophy manifesting as severely 
impaired autonomic control of blood pressure. 
Sildenafil Actavis potentiates the hypotensive effect of nitrates (see section 4.3). 
 
Serious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, unstable angina, sudden cardiac death, 
ventricular arrhythmia, cerebrovascular haemorrhage, transient ischaemic attack, hypertension and 
hypotension have been reported post-marketing in temporal association with the use of sildenafil. 
Most, but not all, of these patients had pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors. Many events were 
reported to occur during or shortly after sexual intercourse and a few were reported to occur shortly 
after the use of sildenafil without sexual activity. It is not possible to determine whether these events 
are related directly to these factors or to other factors. 
Priapism 
Agents for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, including sildenafil, should be used with caution in 
patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (such as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis or 
Peyronie’s disease), or in patients who have conditions which may predispose them to priapism (such 
as sickle cell anaemia, multiple myeloma or leukaemia). 
Prolonged erections and priapism have been reported with sildenafil in post-marketing experience. In 
the event of an erection that persists longer than 4 hours, the patient should seek immediate medical 
assistance. If priapism is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency 
could result. 
Concomitant use with other PDE5 inhibitors or other treatments for erectile dysfunction 
The safety and efficacy of combinations of sildenafil with other PDE5 inhibitors, or other pulmonary 
arterial hypertension (PAH) treatments containing sildenafil (REVATIO), or other treatments for 
erectile dysfunction have not been studied. Therefore the use of such combinations is not 
recommended. 
Effects on vision 
4 
Cases of visual defects have been reported spontaneously in connection with the intake of sildenafil 
and other PDE5 inhibitors (see section 4.8). Cases of non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy, 
a rare condition have been reported spontaneously and in an observational study in connection with 
the intake of sildenafil and other PDE5 inhibitors (see section 4.8). Patients should be advised that in 
the event of any sudden visual defect, they should stop taking Sildenafil Actavis and consult a 
physician immediately (see section 4.3). 
Concomitant use with ritonavir 
Co-administration of sildenafil with ritonavir is not advised (see section 4.5). 
Concomitant use with alpha-blockers 
Caution is advised when sildenafil is administered to patients taking an alpha-blocker, as the 
co-administration may lead to symptomatic hypotension in a few susceptible individuals (see 
section 4.5). This is most likely to occur within 4 hours post sildenafil dosing. In order to minimise the 
potential for developing postural hypotension, patients should be hemodynamically stable on 
alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating sildenafil treatment. Initiation of sildenafil at a dose of 25 mg 
should be considered (see section 4.2). In addition, physicians should advise patients what to do in the 
event of postural hypotensive symptoms. 
Effect on bleeding 
 
Studies with human platelets indicate that sildenafil potentiates the antiaggregatory effect of sodium 
nitroprusside in vitro. There is no safety information on the administration of sildenafil to patients with 
bleeding disorders or active peptic ulceration. Therefore sildenafil should be administered to these 
patients only after careful benefit-risk assessment. 
Women 
Sildenafil Actavis is not indicated for use by women. 
Excipents 
Lactose 
Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-
galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. 
Sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per film-coated tablet, that is to say 
essentially ‘sodium-free’. """

          #     Abiraterone Accord is indicated with prednisone or prednisolone for: 
          #     •  the treatment of newly diagnosed high risk metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer 
          #     (mHSPC) in adult men in combination with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) (see section 
          #     5.1) 
          #     •  the treatment of metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) in adult men who are 
          #     asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic after failure of androgen deprivation therapy in whom 
          #     chemotherapy is not yet clinically indicated (see section 5.1) 
          #     •  the treatment of mCRPC in adult men whose disease has progressed on or after a 
          #     docetaxel-based chemotherapy regimen.

          #     4.2  Posology and method of administration 
              
          #     This medicinal product should be prescribed by an appropriate healthcare professional. 
              
          #     Posology 
          #     The recommended dose is 1000 mg (four 250 mg tablets) as a single daily dose that must not be taken 
          #     with food (see “Method of administration” below). Taking the tablets with food increases systemic 
          #     exposure to abiraterone (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). 
              
          #     Dosage of prednisone or prednisolone 
          #     For mHSPC, Abiraterone Accord is used with 5 mg prednisone or prednisolone daily.  
              
          #     For mCRPC, Abiraterone Accord  is used with 10 mg prednisone or prednisolone daily. 
              
          #     Medical castration with luteinising hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) analogue should be 
          #     continued during treatment in patients not surgically castrated. 
              
          #     Recommended monitoring 
          #     2 
          #     Serum transaminases should be measured prior to starting treatment, every two weeks for the first 
          #     three months of treatment and monthly thereafter. Blood pressure, serum potassium and fluid 
          #     retention should be monitored monthly. However, patients with a significant risk for congestive heart 
          #     failure should be monitored every 2 weeks for the first three months of treatment and monthly 
          #     thereafter (see section 4.4). 
              
          #     In patients with pre-existing hypokalaemia or those that develop hypokalaemia whilst being treated 
          #     with abiraterone acetate, consider maintaining the patient’s potassium level at ≥ 4.0 mM. 
          #     For patients who develop Grade ≥ 3 toxicities including hypertension, hypokalaemia, oedema and 
          #     other non-mineralocorticoid toxicities, treatment should be withheld and appropriate medical 
          #     management should be instituted. Treatment with abiraterone acetate should not be reinitiated until 
          #     symptoms of the toxicity have resolved to Grade 1 or baseline. 
          #     In the event of a missed daily dose of either Abiraterone Accord, prednisone or prednisolone, 
          #     treatment should be resumed the following day with the usual daily dose. 
              
          #     Hepatotoxicity 
          #     For patients who develop hepatotoxicity during treatment (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] increases 
          #     or aspartate aminotransferase [AST] increases above 5 times the upper limit of normal [ULN]), 
          #     treatment should be withheld immediately (see section 4.4). Re-treatment following return of liver 
          #     function tests to the patient’s baseline may be given at a reduced dose of 500 mg (two tablets) once 
          #     daily. For patients being re-treated, serum transaminases should be monitored at a minimum of every 
          #     two weeks for three months and monthly thereafter. If hepatotoxicity recurs at the reduced dose of 
          #     500 mg daily, treatment should be discontinued. 
              
          #     If patients develop severe hepatotoxicity (ALT or AST 20 times the ULN) anytime while on therapy, 
          #     treatment should be discontinued and patients should not be re-treated. 
              
          #     Renal impairment 
          #     No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). However, there 
          #     is no clinical experience in patients with prostate cancer and severe renal impairment. Caution is 
          #     advised in these patients (see section 4.4). 
              
          #     Hepatic impairment 
          #     No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with pre-existing mild hepatic impairment, Child-Pugh 
          #     Class A. 
              
          #     Moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) has been shown to increase the systemic exposure 
          #     to abiraterone acetate by approximately four-fold following single oral doses of abiraterone acetate 
          #     1000 mg (see section 5.2). There are no data on the clinical safety and efficacy of multiple doses of 
          #     abiraterone acetate when administered to patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment 
          #     (Child-Pugh Class B or C). No dose adjustment can be predicted. The use of Abiraterone Accord 
          #     should be cautiously assessed in patients with moderate hepatic impairment, in whom the benefit 
          #     clearly should outweigh the possible risk (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). Abiraterone Accord should not be 
          #     used in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). 
              
          #     Paediatric population 
          #     There is no relevant use of abiraterone acetate  in the paediatric population. 
              
          #     Method of administration 
          #     Abiraterone Accord is for oral use. 
          #     The tablets should be taken at least one hour before or at least two hours after eating. These should be 
          #     swallowed whole with water.

            4.8  Undesirable effects 
 
              Summary of the safety profile 
              In an analysis of adverse reactions of composite Phase 3 studies with abiraterone acetate, adverse 
              reactions that were observed in ≥10% of patients were peripheral oedema, hypokalaemia, 
              hypertension, urinary tract infection, and alanine aminotransferase increased and/or aspartate 
              aminotransferase increased. 
              Other important adverse reactions include, cardiac disorders, hepatotoxicity, fractures, and allergic 
              alveolitis. 
              
              7 
              Abiraterone acetate  may cause hypertension, hypokalaemia and fluid retention as a pharmacodynamic 
              consequence of its mechanism of action. In Phase 3 studies, anticipated mineralocorticoid adverse 
              reactions were seen more commonly in patients treated with abiraterone acetate than in patients 
              treated with placebo: hypokalaemia 18 % vs. 8 %, hypertension 22 % vs. 16 % and fluid retention 
              (peripheral oedema) 23 % vs. 17 %, respectively. In patients treated with abiraterone acetate versus 
              patients treated with placebo: CTCAE (version 4.0) Grades 3 and 4 hypokalaemia were observed in 6 
#               % versus 1 %, CTCAE (version 4.0) Grades 3 and 4 hypertension were observed in 7 % versus 5 %, 
              and fluid retention (peripheral oedema) Grades 3 and 4 were observed in 1 % versus 1 % of patients, 
              respectively. Mineralocorticoid reactions generally were able to be successfully managed medically. 
              Concomitant use of a corticosteroid reduces the incidence and severity of these adverse reactions (see 
              section 4.4). 
              
              Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
              In studies of patients with metastatic advanced prostate cancer who were using an LHRH analogue, or 
              were previously treated with orchiectomy, abiraterone acetate was administered at a dose of 1000 mg 
              daily in combination with low dose prednisone or prednisolone (either 5 or 10 mg daily depending on 
              the indication). 
              
              Adverse reactions observed during clinical studies and post-marketing experience are listed below by 
              frequency category. Frequency categories are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1/10); common 
              (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare 
              (< 1/10,000) and not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data). 
              
              Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

              The following CTCAE (version 4.0) Grade 3 adverse reactions occurred in patients treated with 
              abiraterone acetate: hypokalaemia 5%; urinary tract infection 2%; alanine aminotransferase increased 
              and/or aspartate aminotransferase increased 4%; hypertension 6%; fractures 2%; peripheral oedema, 
              cardiac failure, and atrial fibrillation 1% each. CTCAE (version 4.0) Grade 3 hypertriglyceridaemia 
              and angina pectoris occurred in < 1% of patients. CTCAE (version 4.0) Grade 4 urinary tract 
              infection, alanine aminotransferase increased and/or aspartate aminotransferase increased, 
              hypokalemia, cardiac failure, atrial fibrillation, and fractures occurred in < 1% of patients. 
              
              A higher incidence of hypertension and hypokalemia was observed in the hormone sensitive 
              population (study 3011). Hypertension was reported in 36.7% of patients in the hormone sensitive 
              population (study 3011) compared to 11.8% and 20.2% in studies 301 and 302, respectively. 
              Hypokalemia was observed in 20.4% of patients in the hormone sensitive population (study 3011) 
              compared to 19.2% and 14.9% in 301 and 302, respectively).  
              
              The incidence and severity of adverse events was higher in the subgroup of patients with baseline 
              ECOG 2 performance status grade and also in elderly patients (≥75 years). 
              
              Description of selected adverse reactions 
              Cardiovascular reactions 
              The three Phase 3 studies excluded patients with uncontrolled hypertension, clinically significant 
              heart disease as evidenced by myocardial infarction, or arterial thrombotic events in the past 
              6 months, severe or unstable angina, or NYHA Class III or IV heart failure (study 301) or Class II to 
              IVheart failure (studies 3011 and 302) or cardiac ejection fraction measurement of < 50%. All 
              patients enrolled (both active and placebo-treated patients) were concomitantly treated with androgen 
              deprivation therapy, predominantly with the use of LHRH analogues, which has been associated with 
              diabetes, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident and sudden cardiac death. The incidence of 
              cardiovascular adverse reactions in the Phase 3 studies in patients taking abiraterone acetate versus 
              patients taking placebo were as follows: atrial fibrillation 2.6% vs. 2.0%, tachycardia 1.9% vs. 1.0%, 
              angina pectoris 1.7% vs. 0.8%, cardiac failure 0.7% vs. 0.2%, and arrhythmia 0.7% vs. 0.5%. 
              
              Hepatotoxicity 
              Hepatotoxicity with elevated ALT, AST and total bilirubin has been reported in patients treated with 
              abiraterone acetate. Across Phase 3 clinical studies, hepatotoxicity grades 3 and 4 (e.g., ALT or AST 
              increases of > 5 x ULN or bilirubin increases > 1.5 x ULN) were reported in approximately 6% of 
              patients who received abiraterone acetate, typically during the first 3 months after starting treatment. 
              In Study 3011, grade 3 or 4 hepatotoxicity was observed in 8.4% of patients treated with abiraterone 
              acetate . Ten patients who received abiraterone acetate were discontinued because of hepatotoxicity; 
              two had Grade 2 hepatotoxicity, six had Grade 3 hepatotoxicity, and two had Grade 4 hepatotoxicity. 
              No patient died of hepatotoxicity in Study 3011. In the Phase 3 clinical studies, patients whose 
              baseline ALT or AST were elevated were more likely to experience liver function test elevations than 
              those beginning with normal values. When elevations of either ALT or AST > 5 x ULN, or elevations 
              in bilirubin > 3 x ULN were observed, abiraterone acetate was withheld or discontinued. In two 
              instances marked increases in liver function tests occurred (see section 4.4). These two patients with 
              normal baseline hepatic function, experienced ALT or AST elevations 15 to 40 x ULN and bilirubin 
              elevations 2 to 6 x ULN. Upon discontinuation of treatment, both patients had normalisation of their 
              liver function tests and one patient was re-treated without recurrence of the elevations. In study 302, 
              Grade 3 or 4 ALT or AST elevations were observed in 35 (6.5%) patients treated with abiraterone 
              acetate. Aminotransferase elevations resolved in all but 3 patients (2 with new multiple liver 
              metastases and 1 with AST elevation approximately 3 weeks after the last dose of abiraterone 
              9 
              acetate). In Phase 3 clinical studies, treatment discontinuations due to ALT and AST increases or 
              abnormal hepatic function were reported in 1.1% of patients treated with abiraterone acetate and 0.6% 
              of patients treated with placebo; no deaths were reported due to hepatotoxicity events. 
              
              In clinical studies, the risk for hepatotoxicity was mitigated by exclusion of patients with baseline 
              hepatitis or significant abnormalities of liver function tests. In the 3011 study, patients with baseline 
              ALT and AST > 2.5 x ULN, bilirubin > 1.5 x ULN or those with active or symptomatic viral hepatitis 
              or chronic liver disease; ascites or bleeding disorders secondary to hepatic dysfunction were excluded. 
              In the 301 study, patients with baseline ALT and AST ≥ 2.5 x  ULN in the absence of liver metastases 
              and > 5 x ULN in the presence of liver metastases were excluded. In the 302 study, patients with liver 
              metastases were not eligible and patients with baseline ALT and AST ≥ 2.5 x ULN were excluded. 
              Abnormal liver function tests developing in patients participating in clinical studies were vigorously 
              managed by requiring treatment interruption and permitting re-treatment only after return of liver 
              function tests to the patient’s baseline (see section 4.2). Patients with elevations of ALT or AST 
              > 20 x ULN were not re-treated. The safety of re-treatment in such patients is unknown. The 
              mechanism for hepatotoxicity is not understood. 
              
              Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
              
              Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
              allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
              professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system

                for the treatment of patients with Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) Abiraterone 
                acetate tablets are a CYP17 inhibitor indicated in combination with prednisone for the treatment of 
                patients with  metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).''',
               '''
                2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer:  Abiraterone acetate tablets 
                1,000 mg orally once daily with prednisone 5 mg orally  twice  daily. (2.1)  Patients receiving abiraterone 
                acetate tablets should also receive a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog concurrently or should have 
                had bilateral orchiectomy. Abiraterone acetate tablets must be taken on an empty stomach with water at least 1 
                hour before or 2 hours after a meal. Do not crush or chew tablets. (2.3)  Dose Modification:  For patients with 
                baseline moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B), reduce the abiraterone acetate tablets starting dose 
                to 250 mg once daily. (2.4) For patients who develop hepatotoxicity during treatment, hold abiraterone acetate tablets 
                until recovery. Retreatment may be initiated at a reduced dose. Abiraterone acetate tablets should be discontinued if patients 
                develop severe hepatotoxicity. (2.4) 2.1 Recommended Dose for metastatic CRPC The recommended dose of abiraterone acetate 
                tablets is 1,000 mg (four 250 mg tablets) orally once daily in combination with prednisone 5 mg administered orally  twice 
                daily. 2.3 Important Administration Instructions Patients receiving abiraterone acetate tablets should also receive a 
                gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog concurrently or should have had bilateral orchiectomy. Abiraterone acetate
                tablets must be taken on an empty stomach, either one hour before or two hours after a meal  [see  Clinical Pharmacology 
                  (12.3) ] 2.4 Dose Modification Guidelines in Hepatic Impairment and Hepatotoxicity Hepatic Impairment In patients with
                   baseline moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B), reduce the recommended dose of abiraterone acetate tablets
                    to 250 mg once daily. In patients with moderate hepatic impairment monitor ALT, AST, and bilirubin prior to the start 
                    of treatment, every week for the first month, every two weeks for the following two months of treatment and monthly thereafter. 
                    If elevations in ALT and/or AST greater than 5X upper limit of normal (ULN) or total bilirubin greater than 3X ULN occur in patients 
                    with baseline moderate hepatic impairment, discontinue abiraterone acetate tablets and do not re-treat patients with abiraterone 
                    acetate tablets  [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.6)  and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .  Do not use abiraterone acetate 
                    tablets in patients with baseline severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). Hepatotoxicity  For patients who develop hepatotoxicity
                     during treatment with abiraterone acetate tablets (ALT and/or AST greater than 5× ULN or total bilirubin greater than 3× ULN),
               interrupt treatment with abiraterone acetate tablets  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]  If hepatotoxicity recurs at the dose of 
               750 mg once daily, re-treatment may be restarted at a reduced dose of 500 mg once daily following return of liver function tests to the 
               patient's baseline or to AST and ALT less than or equal to 2.5× ULN and total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5× ULN.  If hepatotoxicity 
               recurs at the reduced dose of 500 mg once daily, discontinue treatment with abiraterone acetate tablets.  Permanently discontinue abiraterone 
               acetate tablets for patients who develop a concurrent elevation of ALT greater than 3 x ULN and total bilirubin greater than 2 x ULN in the 
               absence of biliary obstruction or other causes responsible for the concurrent elevation  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . 
               2.5 Dose Modification Guidelines for Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Avoid concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, 
               rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital) during abiraterone acetate tablets treatment.   If a strong CYP3A4 inducer must be co-administered, 
               increase the abiraterone acetate tablets dosing frequency to twice a day only during the co-administration period (e.g., from 1,000 mg once daily to 
               1,000 mg twice a day). Reduce the dose back to the previous dose and frequency, if the concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued  [see  Drug 
               Interactions (7.1)  and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .''',

              6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling:   •Hypertension, Hypokalemia, and Fluid Retention due to Mineralocorticoid Excess  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] .  •Adrenocortical Insufficiency  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ].  •Hepatotoxicity  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. The most common adverse reactions (≥10%) are fatigue, arthralgia, hypertension, nausea, edema, hypokalemia, hot flush, diarrhea, vomiting, upper respiratory infection, cough, and headache. (6.1) The most common laboratory abnormalities (> 20%) are anemia, elevated alkaline phosphatase, hypertriglyceridemia, lymphopenia, hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia, and hypokalemia. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Rising Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-866-562-4597 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or  www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in theclinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.  Two randomized placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trials (COU-AA-301 and COU-AA-302) enrolled patients who had metastatic CRPC in which abiraterone acetate was administered orally at a dose of 1,000 mg daily in combination with prednisone 5 mg twice daily in the active treatment arms. Placebo plus prednisone 5 mg twice daily was given to patients on the control arm. Another randomized placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial enrolled patients who had another indication in which abiraterone acetate was administered in combination with prednisone. Placebos were administered to patients in the control arm. Additionally, two other randomized, placebo-controlled trials were conducted in patients with metastatic CRPC. The safety data pooled from 2230 patients in randomized controlled trials constitute the basis for the data presented in the Warnings and Precautions, Grade 1-4 adverse reactions, and Grade 1-4 laboratory abnormalities. In all trials, a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog or prior orchiectomy was required in both arms.  In the pooled data, median treatment duration was 11 months (0.1, 43) for abiraterone acetate-treated patients and 7.2 months (0.1, 43) for placebo-treated patients. The most common adverse reactions (≥10%) that occured more commonly (≥2%) in the abiraterone acetate arm were fatigue, arthralgia, hypertension, nausea, edema, hypokalemia, hot flush, diarrhea, vomiting, upper respiratory infection, cough, and headache. The most common laboratory abnormalities (≥20%) that occurred more commonly (≥2%) in the abiraterone acetate arm were anemia, elevated alkaline phosphatase, hypertriglyceridemia, lymphopenia, hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia, and hypokalemia. Grades 3-4 adverse events were reported for 53% of patient in the abiraterone acetate arm and 46% of patients in the placebo arm. Treatment discontinuation was reported in 14% of patients in the abiraterone acetate arm and 13% of patients in the placebo arm. The common adverse events (≥1%) resulting in discontinuation of abiraterone acetate and prednisone were hepatotoxicity and cardiac disorders.  Deaths associated with treatment-emergent adverse events were reported for 7.5% of patients in the abiraterone acetate arm and 6.6% of patients in the placebo arm. Of the patients in the abiraterone acetate arm, the most common cause of death was disease progression (3.3%). Other reported causes of death in ≥5 patients included pneumonia, cardio-respiratory arrest, death (no additional information), and general physical health deterioration. COU-AA-301: Metastatic CRPC Following Chemotherapy  COU-AA-301 enrolled 1195 patients with metastatic CRPC who had received prior docetaxel chemotherapy. Patients were not eligible if AST and/or ALT ≥2.5X ULN in the absence of liver metastases. Patients with liver metastases were excluded if AST and/or ALT >5X ULN.  Table 1 shows adverse reactions on the abiraterone acetate arm in COU-AA-301 that occurred with a ≥2%absolute increase in frequency compared to placebo or were events of special interest.

Grade 3–4 cardiac failure occurred in 1.3% of patients taking abiraterone acetate and led to 5 treatment discontinuations and 4 deaths. Grade 3–4 cardiac failure occurred in 0.2% of patients taking placebo. There were no treatment discontinuations and two deaths due to cardiac failure in the placebo group.  In the same combined data, the majority of arrhythmias were grade 1 or 2. There was one death associated with arrhythmia and three patients with sudden death in the abiraterone acetate arms and five deaths in the placebo arms. There were 7 (0.3%) deaths due to cardiorespiratory arrest in the abiraterone acetate arms and 2 (0.1%) deaths in the placebo arms. Myocardial ischemia or myocardial infarction led to death in 3 patients in the placebo arms and 3 deaths in the abiraterone acetate arms. 6.2 Post Marketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of abiraterone acetate with prednisone. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception. (8.3)  Do not use abiraterone acetate in patients with baseline severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). (8.6) 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary  Abiraterone acetate is not indicated for use in women. There is no information available on the presence of abiraterone acetate in human milk, or on the effects on the breastfed child or milk production. 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary  Based on findings from animal studies and the mechanism of action, abiraterone acetate is contraindicated for use in pregnant women because the drug can cause fetal harm and potential loss of pregnancy. Abiraterone acetateis not indicated for use in females.  There are no human data on the use of abiraterone acetate in pregnant women. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of abiraterone acetate to pregnant rats during organogenesis caused adverse developmental effects at maternal exposures approximately ≥ 0.03 times the human exposure (AUC) at the recommended dose  (see Data). Data Animal Data  In an embryo-fetal developmental toxicity study in rats, abiraterone acetate caused developmental toxicity when administered at oral doses of 10, 30 or 100 mg/kg/day throughout the period of organogenesis (gestational days 6-17). Findings included embryo-fetal lethality (increased post implantation loss and resorptions and decreased number of live fetuses), fetal developmental delay (skeletal effects) and urogenital effects (bilateral ureter dilation) at doses ≥10 mg/kg/day, decreased fetal ano-genital distance at ≥30 mg/kg/day, and decreased fetal body weight at 100 mg/kg/day. Doses ≥10 mg/kg/day caused material toxicity. The doses tested in rats resulted in systemic exposures (AUC) approximately 0.03, 0.1 and 0.3 times, respectively, the AUC in patients. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Males  Based on findings in animal reproduction studies and its mechanism of action, advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 3 weeks after the final dose of abiraterone acetate  [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].  Infertility  Based on animal studies, abiraterone acetate may impair reproductive function and fertility in males of reproductive potential  [see  Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of abiraterone acetate in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients receiving abiraterone acetate in randomized clinical trials, 70%of patients were 65 years and over and 27% were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these elderly patients and younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. 8.6 Patients with Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of abiraterone were examined in subjects with baseline mild (N=8) or moderate (N=8) hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A and B, respectively) and in 8 healthy control subjects with normal hepatic function. The systemic exposure (AUC) of abiraterone after a single oral 1,000 mg dose of abiraterone acetate increased by approximately 1.1-fold and 3.6-fold in subjects with mild and moderate baseline hepatic impairment, respectively compared to subjects with normal hepatic function.  In another trial, the pharmacokinetics of abiraterone were examined in subjects with baseline severe (N=8) hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) and in 8 healthy control subjects with normal hepatic function. The systemic exposure (AUC) of abiraterone increased by approximately 7-fold and the fraction of free drug increased 2-fold in subjects with severe baseline hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function.  No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with baseline mild hepatic impairment. In patients with baseline moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B), reduce the recommended dose of abiraterone acetate to 250 mg once daily. Do not use abiraterone acetate in patients with baseline severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). If elevations in ALT or AST >5X ULN or total bilirubin >3X ULN occur in patients with baseline moderate hepatic impairment, discontinue abiraterone acetate treatment  [see  Dosage and Administration (2.4) and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].  For patients who develop hepatotoxicity during treatment, interruption of treatment and dosage adjustment may be required  [see  Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.3) Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.7 Patients with Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment  [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ].

              4.2  Posology and method of administration 
              
              This medicinal product should be prescribed by an appropriate healthcare professional. 
              
              Posology 
              The recommended dose is 1000 mg (four 250 mg tablets) as a single daily dose that must not be taken 
              with food (see “Method of administration” below). Taking the tablets with food increases systemic 
              exposure to abiraterone (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). 
              
              Dosage of prednisone or prednisolone 
              For mHSPC, Abiraterone Accord is used with 5 mg prednisone or prednisolone daily.  
              
              For mCRPC, Abiraterone Accord  is used with 10 mg prednisone or prednisolone daily. 
              
              Medical castration with luteinising hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) analogue should be 
              continued during treatment in patients not surgically castrated. 
              
              Recommended monitoring 
              2 
              Serum transaminases should be measured prior to starting treatment, every two weeks for the first 
              three months of treatment and monthly thereafter. Blood pressure, serum potassium and fluid 
              retention should be monitored monthly. However, patients with a significant risk for congestive heart 
              failure should be monitored every 2 weeks for the first three months of treatment and monthly 
              thereafter (see section 4.4). 
              
              In patients with pre-existing hypokalaemia or those that develop hypokalaemia whilst being treated 
              with abiraterone acetate, consider maintaining the patient’s potassium level at ≥ 4.0 mM. 
              For patients who develop Grade ≥ 3 toxicities including hypertension, hypokalaemia, oedema and 
              other non-mineralocorticoid toxicities, treatment should be withheld and appropriate medical 
              management should be instituted. Treatment with abiraterone acetate should not be reinitiated until 
              symptoms of the toxicity have resolved to Grade 1 or baseline. 
              In the event of a missed daily dose of either Abiraterone Accord, prednisone or prednisolone, 
              treatment should be resumed the following day with the usual daily dose. 
              
              Hepatotoxicity 
              For patients who develop hepatotoxicity during treatment (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] increases 
              or aspartate aminotransferase [AST] increases above 5 times the upper limit of normal [ULN]), 
              treatment should be withheld immediately (see section 4.4). Re-treatment following return of liver 
              function tests to the patient’s baseline may be given at a reduced dose of 500 mg (two tablets) once 
              daily. For patients being re-treated, serum transaminases should be monitored at a minimum of every 
              two weeks for three months and monthly thereafter. If hepatotoxicity recurs at the reduced dose of 
              500 mg daily, treatment should be discontinued. 
              
              If patients develop severe hepatotoxicity (ALT or AST 20 times the ULN) anytime while on therapy, 
              treatment should be discontinued and patients should not be re-treated. 
              
              Renal impairment 
              No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). However, there 
              is no clinical experience in patients with prostate cancer and severe renal impairment. Caution is 
              advised in these patients (see section 4.4). 
              
              Hepatic impairment 
              No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with pre-existing mild hepatic impairment, Child-Pugh 
              Class A. 
              
              Moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) has been shown to increase the systemic exposure 
              to abiraterone acetate by approximately four-fold following single oral doses of abiraterone acetate 
              1000 mg (see section 5.2). There are no data on the clinical safety and efficacy of multiple doses of 
              abiraterone acetate when administered to patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment 
              (Child-Pugh Class B or C). No dose adjustment can be predicted. The use of Abiraterone Accord 
              should be cautiously assessed in patients with moderate hepatic impairment, in whom the benefit 
              clearly should outweigh the possible risk (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). Abiraterone Accord should not be 
              used in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). 
              
              Paediatric population 
              There is no relevant use of abiraterone acetate  in the paediatric population. 
              
              Method of administration 
              Abiraterone Accord is for oral use. 
              The tablets should be taken at least one hour before or at least two hours after eating. These should be 
              swallowed whole with water.

          #     Summary of the safety profile 
          #     In an analysis of adverse reactions of composite Phase 3 studies with abiraterone acetate, adverse 
          #     reactions that were observed in ≥10% of patients were peripheral oedema, hypokalaemia, 
          #     hypertension, urinary tract infection, and alanine aminotransferase increased and/or aspartate 
          #     aminotransferase increased. 
          #     Other important adverse reactions include, cardiac disorders, hepatotoxicity, fractures, and allergic 
          #     alveolitis. 
              
          #     7 
          #     Abiraterone acetate  may cause hypertension, hypokalaemia and fluid retention as a pharmacodynamic 
          #     consequence of its mechanism of action. In Phase 3 studies, anticipated mineralocorticoid adverse 
          #     reactions were seen more commonly in patients treated with abiraterone acetate than in patients 
          #     treated with placebo: hypokalaemia 18 % vs. 8 %, hypertension 22 % vs. 16 % and fluid retention 
          #     (peripheral oedema) 23 % vs. 17 %, respectively. In patients treated with abiraterone acetate versus 
          #     patients treated with placebo: CTCAE (version 4.0) Grades 3 and 4 hypokalaemia were observed in 6 
          #     % versus 1 %, CTCAE (version 4.0) Grades 3 and 4 hypertension were observed in 7 % versus 5 %, 
          #     and fluid retention (peripheral oedema) Grades 3 and 4 were observed in 1 % versus 1 % of patients, 
          #     respectively. Mineralocorticoid reactions generally were able to be successfully managed medically. 
          #     Concomitant use of a corticosteroid reduces the incidence and severity of these adverse reactions (see 
          #     section 4.4). 
              
          #     Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
          #     In studies of patients with metastatic advanced prostate cancer who were using an LHRH analogue, or

          #     Description of selected adverse reactions 
          #     Cardiovascular reactions 
          #     The three Phase 3 studies excluded patients with uncontrolled hypertension, clinically significant 
          #     heart disease as evidenced by myocardial infarction, or arterial thrombotic events in the past 
          #     6 months, severe or unstable angina, or NYHA Class III or IV heart failure (study 301) or Class II to 
          #     IVheart failure (studies 3011 and 302) or cardiac ejection fraction measurement of < 50%. All 
          #     patients enrolled (both active and placebo-treated patients) were concomitantly treated with androgen 
          #     deprivation therapy, predominantly with the use of LHRH analogues, which has been associated with 
          #     diabetes, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident and sudden cardiac death. The incidence of 
          #     cardiovascular adverse reactions in the Phase 3 studies in patients taking abiraterone acetate versus 
          #     patients taking placebo were as follows: atrial fibrillation 2.6% vs. 2.0%, tachycardia 1.9% vs. 1.0%, 
          #     angina pectoris 1.7% vs. 0.8%, cardiac failure 0.7% vs. 0.2%, and arrhythmia 0.7% vs. 0.5%. 
              
          #     Hepatotoxicity 
          #     Hepatotoxicity with elevated ALT, AST and total bilirubin has been reported in patients treated with 
          #     abiraterone acetate. Across Phase 3 clinical studies, hepatotoxicity grades 3 and 4 (e.g., ALT or AST 
          #     increases of > 5 x ULN or bilirubin increases > 1.5 x ULN) were reported in approximately 6% of 
          #     patients who received abiraterone acetate, typically during the first 3 months after starting treatment. 
          #     In Study 3011, grade 3 or 4 hepatotoxicity was observed in 8.4% of patients treated with abiraterone 
          #     acetate . Ten patients who received abiraterone acetate were discontinued because of hepatotoxicity; 
          #     two had Grade 2 hepatotoxicity, six had Grade 3 hepatotoxicity, and two had Grade 4 hepatotoxicity. 
          #     No patient died of hepatotoxicity in Study 3011. In the Phase 3 clinical studies, patients whose 
          #     baseline ALT or AST were elevated were more likely to experience liver function test elevations than 
          #     those beginning with normal values. When elevations of either ALT or AST > 5 x ULN, or elevations 
          #     in bilirubin > 3 x ULN were observed, abiraterone acetate was withheld or discontinued. In two 
          #     instances marked increases in liver function tests occurred (see section 4.4). These two patients with 
          #     normal baseline hepatic function, experienced ALT or AST elevations 15 to 40 x ULN and bilirubin 
          #     elevations 2 to 6 x ULN. Upon discontinuation of treatment, both patients had normalisation of their 
          #     liver function tests and one patient was re-treated without recurrence of the elevations. In study 302, 
          #     Grade 3 or 4 ALT or AST elevations were observed in 35 (6.5%) patients treated with abiraterone 
          #     acetate. Aminotransferase elevations resolved in all but 3 patients (2 with new multiple liver 
          #     metastases and 1 with AST elevation approximately 3 weeks after the last dose of abiraterone 
          #     9 
          #     acetate). In Phase 3 clinical studies, treatment discontinuations due to ALT and AST increases or 
          #     abnormal hepatic function were reported in 1.1% of patients treated with abiraterone acetate and 0.6% 
          #     of patients treated with placebo; no deaths were reported due to hepatotoxicity events. 
              
          #     In clinical studies, the risk for hepatotoxicity was mitigated by exclusion of patients with baseline 
          #     hepatitis or significant abnormalities of liver function tests. In the 3011 study, patients with baseline 
          #     ALT and AST > 2.5 x ULN, bilirubin > 1.5 x ULN or those with active or symptomatic viral hepatitis 
          #     or chronic liver disease; ascites or bleeding disorders secondary to hepatic dysfunction were excluded. 
          #     In the 301 study, patients with baseline ALT and AST ≥ 2.5 x  ULN in the absence of liver metastases 
          #     and > 5 x ULN in the presence of liver metastases were excluded. In the 302 study, patients with liver 
          #     metastases were not eligible and patients with baseline ALT and AST ≥ 2.5 x ULN were excluded. 
          #     Abnormal liver function tests developing in patients participating in clinical studies were vigorously 
          #     managed by requiring treatment interruption and permitting re-treatment only after return of liver 
          #     function tests to the patient’s baseline (see section 4.2). Patients with elevations of ALT or AST 
          #     > 20 x ULN were not re-treated. The safety of re-treatment in such patients is unknown. The 
          #     mechanism for hepatotoxicity is not understood. 
              
          #     Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
              
          #     Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It

                2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer:  Abiraterone acetate tablets 
                1,000 mg orally once daily with prednisone 5 mg orally  twice  daily. (2.1)  Patients receiving abiraterone 
                acetate tablets should also receive a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog concurrently or should have 
                had bilateral orchiectomy. Abiraterone acetate tablets must be taken on an empty stomach with water at least 1 
                hour before or 2 hours after a meal. Do not crush or chew tablets. (2.3)  Dose Modification:  For patients with 
                baseline moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B), reduce the abiraterone acetate tablets starting dose 
                to 250 mg once daily. (2.4) For patients who develop hepatotoxicity during treatment, hold abiraterone acetate tablets 
                until recovery. Retreatment may be initiated at a reduced dose. Abiraterone acetate tablets should be discontinued if patients 
                develop severe hepatotoxicity. (2.4) 2.1 Recommended Dose for metastatic CRPC The recommended dose of abiraterone acetate 
                tablets is 1,000 mg (four 250 mg tablets) orally once daily in combination with prednisone 5 mg administered orally  twice 
                daily. 2.3 Important Administration Instructions Patients receiving abiraterone acetate tablets should also receive a 
                gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog concurrently or should have had bilateral orchiectomy. Abiraterone acetate
                tablets must be taken on an empty stomach, either one hour before or two hours after a meal  [see  Clinical Pharmacology

               patient's baseline or to AST and ALT less than or equal to 2.5× ULN and total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5× ULN.  If hepatotoxicity 
               recurs at the reduced dose of 500 mg once daily, discontinue treatment with abiraterone acetate tablets.  Permanently discontinue abiraterone 
               acetate tablets for patients who develop a concurrent elevation of ALT greater than 3 x ULN and total bilirubin greater than 2 x ULN in the 
               absence of biliary obstruction or other causes responsible for the concurrent elevation  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . 
               2.5 Dose Modification Guidelines for Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Avoid concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, 
               rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital) during abiraterone acetate tablets treatment.   If a strong CYP3A4 inducer must be co-administered, 
               increase the abiraterone acetate tablets dosing frequency to twice a day only during the co-administration period (e.g., from 1,000 mg once daily to 
               1,000 mg twice a day). Reduce the dose back to the previous dose and frequency, if the concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued  [see  Drug

              6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling:   •Hypertension, Hypokalemia, and Fluid Retention due to Mineralocorticoid Excess  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] .  •Adrenocortical Insufficiency  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ].  •Hepatotoxicity  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. The most common adverse reactions (≥10%) are fatigue, arthralgia, hypertension, nausea, edema, hypokalemia, hot flush, diarrhea, vomiting, upper respiratory infection, cough, and headache. (6.1) The most common laboratory abnormalities (> 20%) are anemia, elevated alkaline phosphatase, hypertriglyceridemia, lymphopenia, hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia, and hypokalemia. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Rising Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-866-562-4597 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or  www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in theclinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.  Two randomized placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trials (COU-AA-301 and COU-AA-302) enrolled patients who had metastatic CRPC in which abiraterone acetate was administered orally at a dose of 1,000 mg daily in combination with prednisone 5 mg twice daily in the active treatment arms. Placebo plus prednisone 5 mg twice daily was given to patients on the control arm. Another randomized placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial enrolled patients who had another indication in which abiraterone acetate was administered in combination with prednisone. Placebos were administered to patients in the control arm. Additionally, two other randomized, placebo-controlled trials were conducted in patients with metastatic CRPC. The safety data pooled from 2230 patients in randomized controlled trials constitute the basis for the data presented in the Warnings and Precautions, Grade 1-4 adverse reactions, and Grade 1-4 laboratory abnormalities. In all trials, a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog or prior orchiectomy was required in both arms.  In the pooled data, median treatment duration was 11 months (0.1, 43) for abiraterone acetate-treated patients and 7.2 months (0.1, 43) for placebo-treated patients. The most common adverse reactions (≥10%) that occured more commonly (≥2%) in the abiraterone acetate arm were fatigue, arthralgia, hypertension, nausea, edema, hypokalemia, hot flush, diarrhea, vomiting, upper respiratory infection, cough, and headache. The most common laboratory abnormalities (≥20%) that occurred more commonly (≥2%) in the abiraterone acetate arm were anemia, elevated alkaline phosphatase, hypertriglyceridemia, lymphopenia, hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia, and hypokalemia. Grades 3-4 adverse events were reported for 53% of patient in the abiraterone acetate arm and 46% of patients in the placebo arm. Treatment discontinuation was reported in 14% of patients in the abiraterone acetate arm and 13% of patients in the placebo arm. The common adverse events (≥1%) resulting in discontinuation of abiraterone acetate and prednisone were hepatotoxicity and cardiac disorders.  Deaths associated with treatment-emergent adverse events were reported for 7.5% of patients in the abiraterone acetate arm and 6.6% of patients in the placebo arm. Of the patients in the abiraterone acetate arm, the most common cause of death was disease progression (3.3%). Other reported causes of death in ≥5 patients included pneumonia, cardio-respiratory arrest, death (no additional information), and general physical health deterioration. COU-AA-301: Metastatic CRPC Following Chemotherapy  COU-AA-301 enrolled 1195 patients with metastatic CRPC who had received prior docetaxel chemotherapy. Patients were not eligible if AST and/or ALT ≥2.5X ULN in the absence of liver metastases. Patients with liver metastases were excluded if AST and/or ALT >5X ULN.  Table 1 shows adverse reactions on the abiraterone acetate arm in COU-AA-301 that occurred with a ≥2%absolute increase in frequency compared to placebo or were events of special interest.

Grade 3–4 cardiac failure occurred in 1.3% of patients taking abiraterone acetate and led to 5 treatment discontinuations and 4 deaths. Grade 3–4 cardiac failure occurred in 0.2% of patients taking placebo. There were no treatment discontinuations and two deaths due to cardiac failure in the placebo group.  In the same combined data, the majority of arrhythmias were grade 1 or 2. There was one death associated with arrhythmia and three patients with sudden death in the abiraterone acetate arms and five deaths in the placebo arms. There were 7 (0.3%) deaths due to cardiorespiratory arrest in the abiraterone acetate arms and 2 (0.1%) deaths in the placebo arms. Myocardial ischemia or myocardial infarction led to death in 3 patients in the placebo arms and 3 deaths in the abiraterone acetate arms. 6.2 Post Marketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of abiraterone acetate with prednisone. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception. (8.3)  Do not use abiraterone acetate in patients with baseline severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). (8.6) 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary  Abiraterone acetate is not indicated for use in women. There is no information available on the presence of abiraterone acetate in human milk, or on the effects on the breastfed child or milk production. 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary  Based on findings from animal studies and the mechanism of action, abiraterone acetate is contraindicated for use in pregnant women because the drug can cause fetal harm and potential loss of pregnancy. Abiraterone acetateis not indicated for use in females.  There are no human data on the use of abiraterone acetate in pregnant women. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of abiraterone acetate to pregnant rats during organogenesis caused adverse developmental effects at maternal exposures approximately ≥ 0.03 times the human exposure (AUC) at the recommended dose  (see Data). Data Animal Data  In an embryo-fetal developmental toxicity study in rats, abiraterone acetate caused developmental toxicity when administered at oral doses of 10, 30 or 100 mg/kg/day throughout the period of organogenesis (gestational days 6-17). Findings included embryo-fetal lethality (increased post implantation loss and resorptions and decreased number of live fetuses), fetal developmental delay (skeletal effects) and urogenital effects (bilateral ureter dilation) at doses ≥10 mg/kg/day, decreased fetal ano-genital distance at ≥30 mg/kg/day, and decreased fetal body weight at 100 mg/kg/day. Doses ≥10 mg/kg/day caused material toxicity. The doses tested in rats resulted in systemic exposures (AUC) approximately 0.03, 0.1 and 0.3 times, respectively, the AUC in patients. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Males  Based on findings in animal reproduction studies and its mechanism of action, advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 3 weeks after the final dose of abiraterone acetate  [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].  Infertility  Based on animal studies, abiraterone acetate may impair reproductive function and fertility in males of reproductive potential  [see  Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of abiraterone acetate in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients receiving abiraterone acetate in randomized clinical trials, 70%of patients were 65 years and over and 27% were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these elderly patients and younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. 8.6 Patients with Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of abiraterone were examined in subjects with baseline mild (N=8) or moderate (N=8) hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A and B, respectively) and in 8 healthy control subjects with normal hepatic function. The systemic exposure (AUC) of abiraterone after a single oral 1,000 mg dose of abiraterone acetate increased by approximately 1.1-fold and 3.6-fold in subjects with mild and moderate baseline hepatic impairment, respectively compared to subjects with normal hepatic function.  In another trial, the pharmacokinetics of abiraterone were examined in subjects with baseline severe (N=8) hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) and in 8 healthy control subjects with normal hepatic function. The systemic exposure (AUC) of abiraterone increased by approximately 7-fold and the fraction of free drug increased 2-fold in subjects with severe baseline hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function.  No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with baseline mild hepatic impairment. In patients with baseline moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B), reduce the recommended dose of abiraterone acetate to 250 mg once daily. Do not use abiraterone acetate in patients with baseline severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). If elevations in ALT or AST >5X ULN or total bilirubin >3X ULN occur in patients with baseline moderate hepatic impairment, discontinue abiraterone acetate treatment  [see  Dosage and Administration (2.4) and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].  For patients who develop hepatotoxicity during treatment, interruption of treatment and dosage adjustment may be required  [see  Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.3) Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.7 Patients with Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment  [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ].
